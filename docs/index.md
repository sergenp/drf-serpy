## drf_serpy documentation

This project is a fork of and improved version of [serpy](https://github.com/clarkduvall/serpy) for *Django Rest Framework*

This project depends on drf-yasg for openapi documentation creation, that's why it also requires whatever drf-yasg requires, which is basically Django and DRF.
